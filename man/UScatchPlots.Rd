UScatchPlots(
  doPNG = TRUE,
  nyears = 5,
  preliminary = TRUE,
  cex.title = c(3, 1.3)[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{doPNG}{A logical specifying if png files should be saved.}

\item{nyears}{The number of years you want to plot. The maximum year
will be found and \code{nyears} will be sequenced into history until
the desired range is found. Years will be included in this range even
if they do not have any data.}

\item{preliminary}{A logical value specifying if the data represents
preliminary data available prior to the first week of January when
the final data pull is normally extracted from the data warehouses.
The default, of \code{TRUE}, adds \code{"(preliminary)"} to the title
of each plot.}

\item{cex.title}{Font size for the main title placed above the figure.
Originally, the default was 1.3, this has since been changed to reflect
that an additional title is not printed on the slide for the JTC meeting.
Thus, a larger title was needed and the default is now .}
