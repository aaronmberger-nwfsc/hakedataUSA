#' For NORPAC data, this will be three digits and
#' is associated with the species name in
#' `NORPAC.DOMESTIC_SPECIES`, using the column `SPECIES_NO`. Note that this
#' value is often called the `OBS` species code in observer landings from the
#' Alaska Fisheries Science Center and is not the `AKR` species code.
#' For example, `206` is Pacific Hake and is the default.
#' For PacFIN data, this will be the entry in `SPID`.
